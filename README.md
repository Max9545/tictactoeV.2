# TicTacToe

This is a childhood classic in which one player marks "X" and the second player "O" in order to try to get three marks in a row in order to win.

## Installation

* A text editing program
* Access to GitHub Repository [TicTacToer](https://github.com/Max9545/tictactoeV.2)
* Perhaps a friend to play with


## Program Languages
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Usage
* X is the first player to go
* Click a box to fill it with your player token
* The second player has a O for a token
* If either player gets three in a row, column, or diagonally then that player has a win added to their win count 
* The game will automatically restart after a win or a draw 
* Win counts are updated as games are played and persist if the page is reloaded
* Whose turn it is is displayed at the top of the page
